        <h2>Learned about me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Isaac Musuayi, a web developer in training originally 
            from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I first 
            discovered my passion for programming through high school 
            studies and additional training in databases (SQL) and web 
            development with JavaScript, MongoDB, and frameworks such as 
            React.js. Since moving to the United States in 2022, I have 
            been pursuing a Web Development program at Highline College, completing most of 
            my classes and applying my skills through practical projects 
            such as building responsive websites and web applications. 
            I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly 
            solutions and eager to keep growing as I apply my knowledge 
            to real-world challenges while continuing to learn new technologies."
